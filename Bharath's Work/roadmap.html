<font size ="3"><u>Smart contracts -</u></font>
Smart contracts work by following simple “if/when…then…” statements that are written into code on a blockchain.
 A network of computers executes the actions  when predetermined conditions have been met and verified.
These actions could include releasing funds to the appropriate parties, registering a vehicle, sending notifications, or issuing a ticket.
 The blockchain is then updated when the transaction is completed. 
That means the transaction cannot be changed, and only parties who have been granted permission can see the results.

Within a smart contract, there can be as many stipulations as needed to satisfy the participants that the task will be completed satisfactorily.
 To establish the terms, participants must determine how transactions and their data are represented on the blockchain, 
agree on the “if/when...then…” rules that govern those transactions, explore all possible exceptions, and define a framework for resolving disputes.

<u>Web3 js Libraries - <Web3 js Libraries> </Web3 js Libraries></u>

The web3.js library is an open source JavaScript library (GNU Lesser General Public License version
 3) built by the Ethereum Foundation, and it includes functions to communicate with an Ethereum node
 via the JavaScript Object Notation - Remote Procedure Call (JSON-RPC) protocol. 
In other words, it is a JavaScript library that allows a developer to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. 
Web3.js is currently on version 1.2.9, which is the version referenced in this article. 
Web3.js is made up of four modules.

<u>Master Solidity - <Master Solidity> </Master Solidity></u>

 In this section, you'll get an introduction to how blockchain works by creating your first Ethereum smart contract with the Solidity programming language.
Before we begin, let me say a few words about Solidity in general.
 It is a very beginner friendly language that looks a lot like other common programming languages like C++, JavaScript, and Python. 
If you know any of these langauges already, you'll have a huge advantage. No worries if not, it's very easy to pick up.
Solidity is a statically typed language, supports inheritance, and external libraries. 
It's a full blown programming language capable of writing sophisticated applications.
